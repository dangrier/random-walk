# Random Walk

## What is this?

Someone asked a question at lunch:

> Say you were standing on an infinite grid of points, and had an equal chance at taking one of three options:
>
> 1. Go straight ahead one grid unit; OR
> 1. Turn left (90 degrees); OR
> 1. Turn right (90 degrees).
>
> if you took some large number of steps doing this same choice+action (say 1M or 1B times), where would you most likely end up?

This repo is just me messing around with some crappy code to play at simulating that to visualise it with a monte carlo style approach.
